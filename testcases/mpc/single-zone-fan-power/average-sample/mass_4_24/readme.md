1.1: case studies that use polunomial equation to predict zone temperature dynamics. The model use 1 historical temperature measurement as one of the inputs.
1.2: case studies that use polunomial equation to predict zone temperature dynamics. The model use 4 historical temperature measurements as part of the inputs.
2.1: case studies that use shallow ANN to predict zone temperature dynamics. The model use 1 historical temperature measurement as one of the inputs.
2.2: case studies that use shallow ANN equation to predict zone temperature dynamics. The model use 4 historical temperature measurements as part of the inputs.
