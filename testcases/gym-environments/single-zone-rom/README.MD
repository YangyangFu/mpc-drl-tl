# Single Zone Reduced Order Fan Speed Control Environment
This DRL environment is to control the fan speed of a fan-coil unit system for minimizing energy costs based on a TOU price while maintaining comfortable indoor thermal environment.

For discrete DRL algorithms:

  - `SingleZoneEnv-ANN-v1`: this is a version for a ANN model.
